# Sensitive Dog Films

## Overview

A website for an audiovisual production company. Users can know more about what the company does, see some of their projects and find its socials. Texts can be seen in portuguese, english or spanish, and there is night/day mode.

## Purpose

This project started as a way to practice applying REACT to real apps, and it has been added to my portfolio. It is also a real production company, so it is currently deployed by the owner.

## Challenges

The challenges of this project were mainly:

- Making the initial animation
- Figuring out how to click on and display the information about each video shown
- Learn how to use react hooks
- Adapt from using vanilla JS to React.js

## Implement

Future features I would like to implement are:

- Make a JSON file to fetch the data displayed
- Improve code efficiency
- Clean up and organize the code for better maintenance
